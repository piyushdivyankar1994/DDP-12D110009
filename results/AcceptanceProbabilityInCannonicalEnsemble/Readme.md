## About this result

### simulation information

- used a lennard jones type potential instead of EAM
- got results that resemble the plot of Fig4 in Sadgih's paper.
- difference maybe because of the fact that the situation at hand is FCC and this means that no of neighbours that I used were different compared to the ones in the paper.
- I used the normalized values of energy that were mentioned in the paper.
